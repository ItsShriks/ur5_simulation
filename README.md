# Prerequisites
```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-universal-robots
sudo apt install ros-noetic-moveit
sudo apt-get install libkdl-parser-dev
```
 # Task 1 游릭
Set up a simulation environment for a UR5 robot using Gazebo use an open source example for the usage of ROS and [Gazebo](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot [ROS-Industrial Universal Robots](http://wiki.ros.org/universal_robot) 
Write a custom ROS node to publish desired joint angles to the UR5 robot in Gazebo publish joint angles as function of sine waves on all of the joints write a launch file which starts all nodes and visualizes the results of this task

```
bash Task1
```
# Task 2 游릭
Write a library which generates 2 kinds of motion.
The first motion is a joint motion between 2 points in joint space. This motion has the following inputs: point1, point2, joints velocity, and joints acceleration.
The second motion is a linear motion between 2 poses in cartesian space. This motion has the following inputs: pose1, pose2, linear velocity, linear acceleration. 
Publish the output of the motions to your Gazebo node from task 1
Write a launch file which starts all nodes and visualizes the results of this task.
```
bash Task2
```

# Task 3 游릭
Provide user API for your motion-library in Python: which should have ability to:
- Read robot state
- Move the robot with joint/linear primitive from task 2
```
bash Task3
```
 
# Task 4 游릭
Propose solution to use LLM for code suggestion with API provided in task 3 using open-sources LLM models.
Code a simple interface of such the co-pilot.
```
bash Task4
```
Note:
The API Key has been removed from the GitHub as it is restricted. You will need to paste your own API Key to run this Task.
